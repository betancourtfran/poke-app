Poke App!

Poke App is an app that I developed as part of a company's screening process.
Is a simple react app created with create-react-app which implements TypeScript.

So in order to run the app you just got to clone/download the project and execute "npm start" on the CLI and that's it!

To run test just execute "npm test" and then "a"

Enjoy!
